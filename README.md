# Design

- For the design aspect of this game I wanted the user to be involved from the start and to have inputs to enter the game.

- As this is a quiz about space, I wanted to incorporate some ideas which can relate to rockets, so I added a countdown sequence at the very start.

- I have used emoji's to give this game more of an inertative feel, I believe images are big part in making a game look and feel fun, which is the whole idea to a game.

- Spaced Out isn't just about answering space questions, but also to the give user a bit more knowledge into space, space technology and space history.

--- 
# User experience

- Once the count sequence is over, a command to enter the players name will appear. Once a name for the user has been entered, the game will run through the basic instructions.


- The game will now start and the questions will appear, followed by a small list of options so the user can guess and enter what they think is the correct anser.


- Once a question has been asnwered, the user will have to stay grounded as no correct or incorrect answer will be given until the end of the game.

- At the end of the game, the game will retieve all the answers the user had given, plus all the correct answers. This if for the user to check against the computer.

---
# Future features
- To add more levels to the game, the higher the level, the harder the questions.

- Count down timer to answer all qustions before the game ends.

- Randomise questions.

- Give a leader board for highest score.

# Technologies 
- All Python mark up was created in a Gitpod workspace.

- Gitpod workspace is then linked to a Github repository. 
https://github.com/

- A hosting cloud platform called Heroku was used to deploy the Github repository, as Heroku is designed to run backend languages such as Python. 
https://id.heroku.com/

- Lucidchart was used for the initial planning by creating a flow chart for the functioning of the game.
https://lucid.app/

# Design
 
 - ADD SCREEN SHOTS FOR FLOW CHART

# Testing

- For the testing purposes of this game, I used the internal PEP8 validation which is a build in validator in Gitpod.

 THAKE PICURE OF ERROR TRERMINAL IN WORKSPACE !!!!!!

- The game has been tested on both Google Chrome and Safari in which the game funcions efficiently.

--- 

# Bugs

- In the build process of this game, I ran multiple error checks throughout the markup as to keeping a 

TAKE PICTURE OF WORK SPACE ERRORS AND HO YOU RESLOVED THEM!!!!

# Deployment 

- In keeping with the rules of deployment with Code Institute, I had to deploy this project using Heruko. 

- Create a Heruko account linked to your email address.

- Once logged in, create a new app which is placed in the top right corner.

- Within new app, click settings and scoll to (build packs)

- Build packs let you select a choice of different technology's which you may be using to build a project. For my project I selected Python and Node JS.

- Node JS build pack is to run the template in which I have used to build my repository in Github, supplied with code Institute. The Python build pack is to tell Heruko what language I will be using to deploy.

- Link the App to your matching GitHub repository.

- Open deployment from the same tool bar as to settings. Select Manual or Automatic  deployment (read details).

- At the bottom of the deployment page, select what branch you will be using. Click deploy branch and wait for the deployment to take place. Your add willm open in a new browser window.

 ADD SCREEN SHOTS OF DEPLOYMENT IN HERUKO!!!

# Acknowledgments 
- To get the game questions and answers I usesa Google search to see what options I had. I found a great and easy site to copy from.
https://quizglobal.com/quizplay/quizplayqanda/Space%20Quiz%20Questions%20and%20Answers

- When writing my Python mark up the work space, I used W3 Schools and Python starter to clear some of the functions and syntax for this project.
https://www.w3schools.com/python/
https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/

- I used Youtube as a good way for explaining and adding each function to write for this game as I was unsure from the start. 

# Credits
- I would like to say a thank you to Code Institute for giving me the tools to build my 3rd project and also my first project using Pyhton.

- A big thank you to my mentor for keeping me on track with the build stages and giving me valuable advise with key areas.

- The slack community has been a great help when I needed it the most, so a thank you to all that answered my qustions and guided me in the process.
